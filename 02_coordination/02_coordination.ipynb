    "A Lock is a powerful tool, but it comes with a cost. The act of acquiring and releasing a lock requires work from the operating system and the Python runtime. More importantly, if a thread tries to acquire a lock that is already held, it is put to sleep — it **blocks**. This context switch (saving its state, scheduling another thread, later restoring it) is **one of the most expensive operations in a system**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider this scenario: You have a shared counter and ten threads. Each thread needs to increment the counter 1,000,000 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** In a perfect world without any locking overhead, how many total operations would be performed? And what is the primary performance cost we introduce when we use a single lock to protect this counter?\n",
    "\n",
    "**10,000,000 total operations.** And a **coarse-grained lock** (a single lock protecting a large or frequently accessed resource) can serialize execution, destroying parallelism and making threads wait unnecessarily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's make this concrete. Here is a comparison table of the two locking strategies we can use for this counter problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Characteristic | Coarse-Grained Lock (Single Lock) | Fine-Grained Locking (No Lock for Counter) |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Concept** | One lock protects the entire shared resource or a large section of code. | The problem is designed to avoid shared state, or locks protect very small, independent resources. |\n",
    "| **Parallelism** | **Low.** Threads spend most of their time waiting. Effectively serial. | **High.** Threads do not block each other; true concurrent execution. |\n",
    "| **Correctness** | Easy to reason about; data race is impossible. | Can be difficult; requires careful design to be correct. |\n",
    "| **Performance** | **Poor.** High overhead from contention and context switching. | **Excellent.** Minimal overhead, linear speedup with more cores. |\n",
    "| **Analogy** | A single, slow checkout line for an entire grocery store. | Every customer uses a self-checkout machine simultaneously. |\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"fine-grained\" solution in this specific case is to avoid shared state altogether. Each thread can increment its own **local counter** and then, only once at the very end, acquire a lock to add its local total to the shared global counter. This reduces 10,000,000 lock acquisitions down to just 10."

    "For ultimate control, you can use a debugger like `gdb` to attach to the running process and get a full backtrace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the step-by-step protocol:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **First, run your deadlocking Python script in one terminal window and let it hang.**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    python3.14t debug_logging.py\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    (It will print the first few lines and then hang, just as you showed).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Open a second terminal window.** Find the Process ID (PID) of your running Python script.\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    ps aux | grep debug_logging.py\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    You'll get output like:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    user     12345  0.5  0.1 287312 14532 pts/0    Sl+  14:30   0:00 python3.14t debug_logging.py\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    The number `12345` is the PID.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Attach the GNU Debugger (`gdb`) to the running process.**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    sudo gdb -p 12345\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    (You need `sudo` because `gdb` attaches to another user's process, even if it's your own).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Inside `gdb`, run this command to get a full backtrace of all threads:**\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    (gdb) thread apply all bt\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    This is the magic command. It applies the `bt` (backtrace) command to *all* threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Analyze the output.** You will see a dump for each thread. The ones stuck in `pthread_cond_wait` or `sem_wait` are your waiting threads. Crucially, you should also see frames from the Python interpreter, like `PyThread_acquire_lock_timed`, which will tell you exactly which Python lock a thread is blocked on.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Detach and quit `gdb` without killing your program:**\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    (gdb) detach\n",
    "    (gdb) quit\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "This `gdb` method is the gold standard for diagnosing a stuck production process. It doesn't require any code changes and gives you a low-level, undeniable picture of what every thread is doing."
