Hello there. I'm Brian Kernighan, and I'll be your mentor for this course, "Python Threading for the AI Architect." It's a pleasure to meet you.

Our goal is to build your expertise in designing scalable, efficient, and maintainable concurrent systems, a cornerstone skill for any serious AI architect. We'll approach this with the rigor of systems programming, drawing on principles from C and Unix to build a deep, foundational understanding.

Let's begin by laying out the entire roadmap. This is your learning plan:

| Stage | Title | Key Topics | Estimated Time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | **Foundations: Concurrency, The GIL, and Threads** | The 'Why' of Concurrency, Python Interpreter & The GIL, `threading` Module Basics, Thread Lifecycle | 3-4 sessions |
| **2** | **Coordination: Synchronization and Communication** | Shared State & Data Races, Locks (RLock, Lock), Semaphores, Conditions, Events, Producer-Consumer Patterns | 3-4 sessions |
| **3** | **Orchestration: Managing Concurrent Work** | Thread Pools (`concurrent.futures`), Queues for Safe Communication, Debugging and Profiling Threaded Code | 2-3 sessions |
| **4** | **Architecture: Design Patterns and Trade-offs** | Threading vs. Multiprocessing vs. Asyncio, Designing a Concurrent Tokenizer, Applying Concurrency to Data Pipelines, System Design Principles | 3-4 sessions |

We'll proceed with one-hour daily sessions, focusing on one major concept per session to ensure solid understanding.
